*new features*

- Use of 'time' as DimCoord. Make 'time' the coordinate of trajectory points 
  instead of a variable. Requires addition of 'ref_time' as a coord,
  indicating the starting point of forward and back trajectories, and 
  introduces 'trajectory_no' as DimCoord for trajectories.
  Also removes need for .stack.apply to loop over trajectories. 
  Code now works for arbitrary number of start points. [\#8]

- Add support for MONC grid by implementing its c-grid
  configuration for where the position scalars are stored.

*maintenance*

- update version of `black` we use for code-cleanup to deal with issue within
  `black` due to changes in its upstream dependency `click`
  (https://github.com/psf/black/issues/2964)
  [\#15](https://github.com/ParaConUK/advtraj/pull/15) @leifdenby

- Switch to using pre-commit for linting (to automatically have linting run on
  each git commit) and use pre-commit for linting during continuous
  integration. Also update README and add development notes to give
  instructions on how to use pre-commit and contribute to advtraj.
