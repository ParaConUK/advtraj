    Map indecies `idx_grid` to the positios in grid defined by the
    cell-centered positions in `da_coord`.

    We assume that the grid-indecies map to the cell-center positions, so
    that for a grid resolution `dx=25.0m` and a grid with two cells with
    a domain of length 50.0 we have the following:

        i:             0           1
        x:      0.0  12.5  25.0  23.5  50.0

    i_est:     -0.5    0    0.5    1    1.5

    We need to allow for the estimated grid indecies `i_est` to map to grid
    positions up to the domain edges, which is outside of the cell-center
    positions. This is done by making the interpolation extend linearly outside
    the value range (by one index at either end)
